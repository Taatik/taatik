[Hebraisk Translitteration](https://github.com/Taatik/hebraisk-translitteration) is a JavaScript module for transliterating Hebrew into Danish.
It was developed with help from the Jewish community in Copenhagen, and funding for this project was graciously provided by [Educating for Impact](https://educatingforimpact.com/)

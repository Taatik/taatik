Rivkah's passion for building efficient and effective data driven products to better improve education and assist non-for-profits is evident through her involvement in both her formal and informal professional activities.
After completing her BA in Economics and Mathematics from Barnard College and a Masters in Applied Mathematics, רבקה worked for a number of Jewish educational nonprofits both in the US and in Europe.
At the same time, רבקה has served in a number of product management roles at ed-tech and fin-tech startups where she utilized data to develop marketing strategies as well as managed teams of engineers to develop and deliver products to help students and users through complicated processes.
Through the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, both in Berlin and Athens, Rivkah taught, managed and coordinated educational programming to further connect Jewish teens to learn, explore and internalize their Jewish heritage.
רבקה has been passionate about developing a transliteration tool since the first time she manually transliterated text from Hebrew to German knowing technology could save hours of time and is thrilled that Ta'atik has been embraced by communities around the globe.
